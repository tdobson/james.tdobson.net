            <h1>We&apos;ve had a baby.</h1>

            <p>His name is <b>James Fox Dobson</b>.</p>

            <p>We&rsquo;d prefer you didn&rsquo;t share his middle name on social media for the moment.</p>


            <h2>Q &amp; A:</h2>
            <h4>Can I tell my close friends or family about him?</h4>
            <p>Please do! Share photos, details, the lot without whomever you think should know. We're tired so don't have headspace to tell everyone who might want to know, so you're welcome to pass on the news.</p>
            <p>We&apos;d prefer you didn&apos;t share on social media: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>his weight </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>hospital </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>precise date of birthday</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>middle name</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>To make this easier, we haven't shared most of these here yet ðŸ™‚</p>

            <p>You&apos;re welcome to share photos of him, so long as it is a somewhat flattering view. Don&apos;t share anything you wouldn&apos;t be comfortable displaying at an 18yr olds Birthday party.</p>
            <h4>Can we send a card?</h4>
            <p>Sure. We&rsquo;re now home, at 3 Werneth Avenue, M14 7BF</p>
            <p>Please don&rsquo;t turn up unannounced. </p>
            <h4>How was labour?</h4>
            <p>Mum had a section after James didn&apos;t respond happily to being induced. </p>

            <p>Delivered smoothly late one evening in early June. </p>

            <p>James is in the smallest 1% of babies and all indications so far is that he&apos;s happy, healthy and hungry. </p>

            <p>Babies usually lose 5% bodyweight after birth, and James has aced that by only losing 3%.</p>

            <p>Jen is up and walking around, just not allowed to lift things or drive for 6 weeks but otherwise seems absolutely fine. Her skin is a little sore, but is really very active.</p>
            <h4>How&rsquo;re you all doing?</h4>
            <p>Learning to figure out sleep. Making progress, but still some way to go.</p>
            <p>Getting there with breast feeding and expressing.</p>
            <p>Hoping the weather stays coolish.</p>
            <h4>Is there an inspiration behind his middle name.?</h4>
            <p>It's just his name.</p>
            <p>His name is not inspired by the band James, a king, X-files, Liam Fox, Michael Fox, the smells or noises he makes, a Jimi Hendrix or Ylvis song. It's just what we chose to call him.</p>
            <h4>Can we send a present?</h4>
            <p>Maybe. We have everything we need for him right now, and our rented house already feels painfully small, and full of baby stuff.</p>
            <p>Is there anything you can do for him that he may appreciate in the future? Is there anything you can do for him that doesn&apos;t require much headspace from the parents right now?</p>

            <p>Tim&apos;s aunt made him a scrapbook when he was born, and Tim&apos;s grandma opened a savings account for him. Books are always welcome. </p>

            <p>Play the long game - if you&apos;re keen to give him something, what can you give that will help him have the best start in life he can?</p>

            <p>Both Tim and Jen like flowers, but we only have a limited number of vases, and a limited amount of space we can put vases or plants. Perhaps surprise us in 3-4 months time?</p>
            <h4>Can we call you?</h4>
            <p>Yes, but please try not to call Tim out of the blue unless you are having an emergency - you will scare him!</p>

            <p>If you&rsquo;re keen for a video call - it is best to drop him a message and schedule something. This may well be the best way of getting a baby to join you too. The best way of getting hold of Tim is on facebook messenger. Alternatively, 01457 597007 will also work.</p>
            <h4>Can we come visit?</h4>
            <p>Probably. We&apos;re keen not to overwhelm our stable with shepherds and wise men. </p>
            <p>Please don&apos;t turn up unannounced. If you&rsquo;re keen to visit, drop Tim a message so we can agree a date. </p>
            <h4>Will he be christened?</h4>
            <p>As neither Jen nor Tim feel current affinity to religion, it&apos;s unlikely he&apos;ll be christened at birth, but we&apos;re planning to hold a secular &apos;naming ceremony&apos; get together in Summer 2024 to celebrate his arrival.</p>

            <p>Whilst we&apos;re not planning that he&apos;ll have godparents, we&apos;re hoping several of our friends will agree to be &quot;guiding lights&quot; in his life, and take a particular focus in guiding and supporting him on his journey.</p>
            <h4>Will he go caving/climbing?</h4>
            <p>Sure - after he&rsquo;s had his vaccinations at around 3 months we&apos;ll start to think about these things. <br />He&rsquo;s unlikely to do Daren Cilau or solo anything in Yosemite before he can support his own head.</p>
            <h4>Did you intend to have him?</h4>
            <p>How much detail do you want? He wasn't a surprise.</p>
